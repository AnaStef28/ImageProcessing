# Image processing

Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. For uni I had this project where I should perform basic image processing tasks (such as brightness and contrast adjustment, applying a filter, etc.) using C++ classes.

## Functions
Each class has their own function, however the image processing itself happens in the ImageProcessing class. The functions are: BrightnessContrast, GammaCorrection, Convolution. Additionally, there is a drawing module where you can draw a circle, a line or a rectangle over the image.
